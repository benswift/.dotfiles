Hi ${1:`(progn (message-add-header "Cc: charles.martin@anu.edu.au")(ben-find-to-firstname))`},

I'm not actually teaching COMP1720/6720 in S2 this year, because I'll be on parental leave. Instead, it'll be taught by my colleague Charles Martin (cc'd). He's awesome, and I'm sure he'll look after you.

Good luck with the coming semester - I'm sure you'll make amazing stuff in the course.

Cheers,
Ben
