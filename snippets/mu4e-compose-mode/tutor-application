Thanks for getting in touch. I really love COMP1720 and I'm really keen to put
together a team of tutors who are like-minded, so reaching out is an encouraging
sign :)

The next steps would be for us to have an in-person chat about the course,
expectations, etc. I realise that you've got exams and things (I've got a bunch
of them to mark Jun 9 onwards) but are you free at all next week for a quick
(maybe 20mins?) chat?

Finally, I want to be up front about the fact that I've already had a lot of
applications for this course, and along with the tutors from last year who are
continuing it's already fairly full-up, so you should pursue other tutoring
options as well. I'm not pushing you away, I just want to give you the full
picture about where the COMP1720 tutor recruitment process is at.
