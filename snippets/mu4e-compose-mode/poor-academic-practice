Dear ${1:name}

I refer to my letter of ${2:`(format-time-string "%b %e %Y")`}
notifying you that I had received an allegation of academic misconduct
in relation to ${3:assessment item} for the course ${4:COMP1720}
and that a review would be conducted in relation to this allegation.

I am writing to inform you that after conducting the review I have
found that your conduct constitutes poor academic practice as per
subrule 20.2 of the Academic Misconduct Rule of the Australian
National University
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L02025). This relates to
$3 for the course $4.

Specifically, I have found that you engaged in:

6.1(a)(i) Cheating
6.1(a)(ii) Plagiarism
6.1(a)(iii) Improperly colluding with another person
6.1(a)(iv) Acting, or assisting another person to act, dishonestly or unfairly in or in connection with an examination
6.1(a)(v) taking a prohibited document into an examination venue
6.1(a)(vi) failing to comply with examination or assessment Rule or directions
6.1(a)(vii) engaging in conduct with a view to gaining unfair or unjustified advantage
6.1(a)(viii) submitting work that is not original

The following outcome is applied in accordance with rule 21:

$0

Any future conduct that constitutes a breach of the Rules may result
in the application of greater penalties or a finding of Academic
Misconduct.

Please note that this does not constitute a record of academic
misconduct on your part but rather serves as confirmation that you
have received education and counselling on this matter.  No record of
this breach appears on your official Academic Transcript.

Under Rule 35 of the Rules, where a finding of poor academic practice
is made, you have the option to apply in writing for a review of the
decision to the Dean of the College.Â If you wish to lodge an appeal,
you must do so to the College Student office within 5 working days of
this email. You should attach any evidence you have to support any
claims that you make in your application. 

The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their
assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The Academic
Skills and Learning Centre offers a number of workshops and seminars
that you may find useful for your studies. Details on upcoming courses

free counselling service to current students. Information on the
