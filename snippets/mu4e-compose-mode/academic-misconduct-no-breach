I wrote to you on ${2:date} concerning alleged academic misconduct by you. You
were advised that an inquiry would be held into the matter in accordance with
the provisions of the ANU Academic Misconduct Rule. You were provided with a
hyperlink to a copy of these rules.

The inquiry was convened on ${3:date} and the allegations of misconduct were
considered.

In reaching my decision I have considered ${4:INSERT ITEMS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING STUDENT‚ÄùS WRITTEN OR VERBAL STATEMENT IF MADE}. 

As per 30.1(a) of the Academic Misconduct Rule I have determined that a breach
