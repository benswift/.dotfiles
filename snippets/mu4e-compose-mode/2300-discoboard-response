Hi ${1:`(ben-find-to-firstname)`}

Thanks for getting back to me - and sorry about the confusion. The serial number
list from one of the labs had got lost in communication between the tutors and
I, but I've found it now and you were indeed in the system.

Good luck with the course, and keep pestering your tutors with questions in the
labs :)

Cheers,
Ben
