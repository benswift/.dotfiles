Dear $4,

Notice under Rule 13 of the Academic Misconduct Rules 2014

I have received a report alleging that you may have engaged in academic
misconduct as per the ANU Academic Misconduct Rules (2014), see
http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01785. The allegations have been
made in relation to your submission for $2 ${5:assessment item} and was
detected by $6.

Pursuant to Clause 13 of the Rules, I consider there are reasonable
grounds for believing that you may have engaged in academic misconduct
and therefore intend to hold an Initial Review of the allegation under
Rule 15.

Allegation of academic misconduct

It is alleged that your behaviour may constitute academic misconduct
pursuant to Sub-Clauses 6.1(a) (i) â€“ (viii) of the Rules in that you are
alleged to potentially have:

6.1(a)(i) Cheating
6.1(a)(ii) Plagiarism
6.1(a)(iii) Improperly colluding with another person
6.1(a)(iv) Acting, or assisting another person to act, dishonestly or unfairly in or in connection with an examination
6.1(a)(v) taking a prohibited document into an examination venue
6.1(a)(vi) failing to comply with examination or assessment Rule or directions
6.1(a)(vii) engaging in conduct with a view to gaining unfair or unjustified advantage
6.1(a)(viii) submitting work that is not original

Notification of Initial Review

This email is notice given to you specifying the nature of the alleged
academic misconduct and advising you that you are entitled to appear at
a meeting that I propose to hold at ${7:time}.

The purpose of the meeting is to investigate whether there is substance
to the allegation and if there is substance to make a finding as to
whether your alleged behaviour constitutes Poor Academic Practice or
Potential Academic Misconduct. The meeting will be held in an informal
manner.

You are entitled to appear in person at the meeting. If you do not so
appear, the Initial Review may proceed in your absence. If you have
reasonable grounds for not being able to appear at the above time,
please contact me immediately by reply email so I can consider that
ground and, if I consider it appropriate, make alternative arrangements.

You may present oral or written statements (whether made by you or
another person) at the meeting.

You may, in addition to, or instead of, appearing in person at the
meeting, furnish to the Initial Review a written statement (whether made
by you or another person) in relation to the alleged academic
misconduct.

Regards,
Dr. Ben Swift
