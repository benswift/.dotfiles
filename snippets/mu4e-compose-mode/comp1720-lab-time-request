Hi ${1:`(progn (message-add-header "Cc: brent.schuetze@anu.edu.au")(ben-find-to-firstname))`}

Sure, I'm keen to help you out with that - will hopefully be doable. Here's a plan:

- you should get ready to sign up with everyone else[0] and try and get in that lab

- if you can't get into that lab, send Brent (cc'd) another email and we'll squeeze you in (we keep a slot in reserve)

Thanks :)

Cheers,
Ben
