Hi ${1:`(ben-find-to-firstname)`}

Ok, I can see you at $2 on Wednesday April 19 - come to my office (N214) at that
time and take a seat on the colourful chairs outside. The meeting will have to
be fairly quick (I have a lot of students to get through).

I'm keen to help you learn where you went wrong, and to help clear up anything
you're confused about. I should say, though, that Uwe and I were pretty careful
to mark the exams fairly for all students, so this isn't a chance to complain
and get a better mark. There are formal processes for appealing a grade at the
end of the course[0], but these happen after a course is finished.

I'm not saying this to be mean, I just want to be clear. I want to help you make
the most of your time in COMP2300, and to learn skills which will set you up in
life and further study.

Cheers,
Ben
