** path

- for git, make sure =c:\git\bin= is in the path
- set =Home= environment variable to =%USERPROFILE%= (not sure if this
  is the best, but it seems to work. you can type 'environment' at the
  start menu to bring up the editing box)
  
** chocolatey

install from https://chocolatey.org/

*** git

make sure it puts all the unix tools on the path, or you're gonna
have a bad time

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
choco install git -params '"/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath"'
#+END_SRC

** Visual Studio

- Download VS Community 2015
- select "custom" install
- specify C++ language support, Win8 SDK

** ssh

=.ssh= dir seems to need to be in =c:\Users\ben=

Git (installed through Chocolatey as above) should install all the
usual ssh utils

** fonts

try the chocolatey package

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
choco install sourcecodepro
#+END_SRC

if that doesn't work, install them manually from https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

* cross-platform
** calibre

to convert a folder of html into an ebook, first, zip up the files
(don't forget -r for recursive) then use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert file.zip .epub -vv --authors "Ben Swift" --language en --level1-toc '//*[@class="title"]' --disable-font-rescaling --page-breaks-before / --no-default-epub-cover
#+END_SRC
