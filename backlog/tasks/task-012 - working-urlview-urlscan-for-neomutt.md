I've tried a few times, using both urlview (doesn't seem to work with
base64-encoded messages and I can't get neomutt to decode before piping?) and
urlscan (as per
<https://hunden.linuxkompis.se/2021/05/22/better-url-management-in-neomutt-with-urlview.html>,
but there are issues with it being run non-interactively I think?).

Anyway it's not a huge issue but it'd be good to fix at some point.
