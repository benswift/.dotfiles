# LLVM IR & TableGen major modes

These files are from the main [LLVM
distribution](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/tree/master/utils/emacs), but
I've copied them here for convenience (I don't usually have an up-to-date LLVM
tree on my machine, but I _do_ need these modes for working with Extempore
stuff).
